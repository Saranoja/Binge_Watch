# Binge Watch

BingeWatch is a tool to monitor the favourite TV shows.
When run, the program will list all episodes that haven't been watched yet, ordered by a specific score the user has previously set.

Another functionality the tool offers is the possibility to search on YouTube for trailers and other uploads that are related to a certain episode of a TV show.

Other possible commands are: snooze a specific show, add or delete one, update its score, update the last seen episode.
